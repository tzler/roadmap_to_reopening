## Latex code to generate the "Roadmap to Reopening" pdf 

This repository contains the [latex file](main.tex "the raw file") used to generate the ["Roadmap to Reopening with Justice and Equity"](manuscript.pdf "the pretty file") manuscript, which accompanied the [Reverse Town Hall](https://www.facebook.com/stanfordsolidaritynetwork/videos/616648232348943/ "video begins at 10:00"). This document and the event was generated and organized by a [coalition of student groups](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/08/27/coalition-of-stanford-organizations-calls-for-reverse-town-hall-to-discuss-systemic-racism-universitys-covid-response-students-basic-needs/ "local press") across campus. To create a more visually accessable format, the original document was manually converted to a pdf using an [online latex editor: overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kknkjwyrwnvh "place where original document was converted to latex"). 

Contents of this repository: 

- `main.tex`: the latex code used to convert the original document into a searchable pdf. Includes lots of custom details that make the document more visual appealing/accessable
- `cover_page.pdf`: an image that serves as the cover page in the final document, which is loaded by `main.tex` when generating the final pdf 
- `manuscript.pdf`: the final document made publically available, generating by the code in `main.tex` and `cover_page.pdf`
